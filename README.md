## Map Weather

Map weather is a simple example map application for displaying some data based on location.
The application calls the [OpenWeatherMap](https://api.openweathermap.org) service to receive weather data
for each marker. Markers are added by clicking on the map, data is updated upon dragging and displayed when clicking
on the marker.

## Demo

The application can be seen [here](https://norama.github.io/weather-map).
